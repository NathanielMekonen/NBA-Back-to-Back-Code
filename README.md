# NBA-Back-to-Back-Code

The goal of this project was to analyze how NBA teams perform in the second game of a back-to-back in comparison to games played with at least one day of rest. 

The data used for this analysis was pulled from the "NBA Box Scores 1990-2020 (Regular and Playoffs)" Kaggle dataset, which contains regular season and playoff box scores from the 1990/91 season to the 2019/20 season, and the "NBA Injuries from 2010-2020" Kaggle dataset, which contains all injury data from 2010 to 2020. For this project, only the 2010/11 to 2019/20 regular season were analyzed.
